Sliding Window Technique
When we slide the window from one position to the next, we:

# Add the new element that enters the window.
# Subtract the old element that leaves the window.

This way, we donâ€™t need to recalculate the sum of the entire subarray from scratch, which saves time and makes the algorithm more efficient.

Initial subarray (first window): [1, 2, 3, 4]
Sum: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)
When we slide the window one position to the right:

New subarray: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Instead of recalculating the sum from scratch, we update it:
currentSubarraySum = 10 + 5 - 1 = 14
Here, 5 is the new element entering the window, and 1 is the old element leaving the window.
similiarly 2,3,...will leave
